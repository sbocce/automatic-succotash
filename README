This is a minimal Finite Volumes solver for the 1D1V collisionless 
gaskinetic theory.
External forcing is provided through a file, as well as a chemical 
source term.
A BGK collision operator is also implemented.

Uses OpenMP for parallelization.

First or second order in space (see Mieussens, Discrete Velocity Model
and Implicit Scheme for the BGK Equation of Rarefied Gas Dynamics).
First order explicit in time.

The solution is written in the "output" directory every "EACH" 
timesteps, where "EACH" is defined in the source.
